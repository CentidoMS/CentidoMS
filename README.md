CentidoMS
=========

CentidoMS is another CMS (Content Management System). I developed it when I was 14 years old. Since then I never updated it.

It was my second attempt on creating a CMS (believe me that my first attempt was much worse than this attempt). I collected a lot of experience from this project.
